# Market Basket Analysis for Product Launch Strategy

Mi recently introduced its latest smartphone, the Redmi Note 7, and the market response has been nothing short of phenomenal. The exclusive launch on Flipkart resulted in a sold-out inventory within just a few hours. With the next sale scheduled for a week later, Flipkart aims to enhance its cross-sell strategies for accompanying accessories.

## Objective
The primary objective was to develop effective cross-sell strategies for complementary accessories during the week leading up to the subsequent Redmi Note 7 sale. With a dataset comprising approximately 100 customer orders, each including a Redmi Note 7 mobile and corresponding accessories, we aimed to discern patterns and recommend mobile covers and tempered glass.
Utilizing Excel, we implemented market basket analysis with a predefined threshold set at 10. This threshold ensured that identified combinations of mobile covers and tempered glass occurred together in at least 10 orders. The findings promise strategic insights and actionable recommendations for optimizing the customer shopping experience during the forthcoming Redmi Note 7 sale.
